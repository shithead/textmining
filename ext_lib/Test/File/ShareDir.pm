=head1 NAME

Test::File::ShareDir - Create a Fake ShareDir for your modules for testing.

=head1 VERSION

version 1.000000

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::More;

    # use FindBin; optional

    use Test::File::ShareDir
        # -root => "$FindBin::Bin/../" # optional,
        -share => {
            -module => { 'My::Module' => 'share/MyModule' }
            -dist   => { 'My-Dist'    => 'share/somefolder' }
        };

    use My::Module;

    use File::ShareDir qw( module_dir dist_dir );

    module_dir( 'My::Module' ) # dir with files from $dist/share/MyModule

    dist_dir( 'My-Dist' ) # dir with files from $dist/share/somefolder

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module only has support for creating 'new' style share dirs and are NOT compatible with old File::ShareDirs.

For this reason, unless you have File::ShareDir 1.00 or later installed, this module will not be usable by you.

=head1 SIMPLE INTERFACE

Starting with version C<0.4.0>, there are a few extra interfaces you can use.

These will probably be more useful, and easier to grok, because they don't have a layer of
indirection in order to simultaneously support both C<Module> and C<Dist> C<ShareDir>'s.

=head2 Simple Exporter Interfaces

=head3 C<Test::File::ShareDir::Dist>

L<< C<Test::File::ShareDir::Dist>|Test::File::ShareDir::Dist >> provides a simple export interface
for making C<TempDir> C<ShareDir>'s from a given path:

    use Test::File::ShareDir::Dist { "Dist-Name" => "share/" };

This will automatically create a C<ShareDir> for C<Dist-Name> in a C<TempDir> based on the contents of C<CWD/share/>

See L<< C<Test::File::ShareDir::Dist>|Test::File::ShareDir::Dist >> for details.

=head3 C<Test::File::ShareDir::Module>

L<< C<Test::File::ShareDir::Module>|Test::File::ShareDir::Module >> provides a simple export interface
for making C<TempDir> C<ShareDir>'s from a given path:

    use Test::File::ShareDir::Module { "Module::Name" => "share/" };

This will automatically create a C<ShareDir> for C<Module::Name> in a C<TempDir> based on the contents of C<CWD/share/>

See L<< C<Test::File::ShareDir::Module>|Test::File::ShareDir::Module >> for details.

=head2 Simple Object Oriented Interfaces

=head3 C<Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Dist>

L<< C<Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Dist>|Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Dist >> provides a simple object oriented interface for
making C<TempDir> C<ShareDir>'s from a given path:

    use Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Dist;

    my $obj = Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Dist->new( dists => { "Dist-Name" => "share/" } );
    $obj->install_all_dists;
    $obj->add_to_inc;

This will automatically create a C<ShareDir> for C<Dist-Name> in a C<TempDir> based on the contents of C<CWD/share/>

See L<< C<Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Dist>|Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Dist >> for details.

=head3 C<Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Module>

L<< C<Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Module>|Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Module >> provides a simple object oriented interface
for making C<TempDir> C<ShareDir>'s from a given path:

    use Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Module;

    my $obj = Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Module->new( modules => { "Module::Name" => "share/" } );
    $obj->install_all_modules;
    $obj->add_to_inc;

This will automatically create a C<ShareDir> for C<Module::Name> in a C<TempDir> based on the contents of C<CWD/share/>

See L<< C<Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Module>|Test::File::ShareDir::Object::Module >> for details.

=head1 IMPORTING

=head2 -root

This parameter is the prefix the other paths are relative to.

If this parameter is not specified, it defaults to the Current Working Directory ( C<CWD> ).

In versions prior to C<0.3.0>, this value was mandatory.

The rationale behind using C<CWD> as the default value is as follows.

=over 4

=item * Most users of this module are likely to be using it to test distributions

=item * Most users of this module will be using it in C<$project/t/> to load files from C<$project/share/>

=item * Most C<CPAN> tools run tests with C<CWD> = $project

=back

Therefor, defaulting to C<CWD> is a reasonably sane default for most people, but where it is not it can
still be overridden.

  -root => "$FindBin::Bin/../" # resolves to project root from t/ regardless of Cwd.

=head2 -share

This parameter is mandatory, and contains a C<hashref> containing the data that explains what directories you want shared.

  -share =>  { ..... }

=head3 -module

C<-module> contains a C<hashref> mapping Module names to path names for module_dir style share dirs.

  -share => {
    -module => { 'My::Module' => 'share/mymodule/', }
  }

  ...

  module_dir('My::Module')

Notedly, it is a C<hashref>, which means there is a limitation of one share dir per module. This is simply because having more
than one share dir per module makes no sense at all.

=head3 -dist

C<-dist> contains a C<hashref> mapping Distribution names to path names for dist_dir style share dirs. The same limitation
applied to C<-module> applies here.

  -share => {
    -dist => { 'My-Dist' => 'share/mydist' }
  }
  ...
  dist_dir('My-Dist')
